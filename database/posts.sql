Whether it\'s supporting each other\'s business endeavors, public appearances or posting sweet online tributes, the Russell-Hawn clan never fails to show up and show out for one another., Kurt and Goldie have four children: Boston Russell, whom Kurt welcomed with ex-wife Season Hubley; Oliver Hudson and Kate Hudson from Goldie\'s previous relationship with Bill Hudson; and Wyatt Russell, the couple\'s youngest, whom they welcomed together., Kate, for her part, doesn\'t believe Kurt and her mom could complement each other any more than they do now. \"Mom is kinetic and she is a butterfly, and Pa likes his family and his home. But when they\'re together, it\'s so powerful,\" she told PEOPLE., In PEOPLE\'s 2020 Beautiful Issue, the Almost Famous star opened up about modeling her mom\'s parenting style, especially regarding raising her daughter. \"Mom was so available to being my greatest cheerleader,\" Kate told PEOPLE. \"It just made me think about Rani — I just hope I give her that kind of confidence.\", \"As a parent, you basically raise your children to raise their children appropriately as well. So that\'s that domino effect,\" Goldie told PEOPLE in March 2022. \"And as parents, we have a tremendous responsibility.\", Here\'s everything to know about Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn\'s children., Goldie welcomed son Oliver with ex-husband Bill Hudson on Sept. 7, 1976. Oliver gained TV recognition for his roles on Rules of Engagement, Nashville, Scream Queens and The Cleaning Lady. He\'s also famously known for hosting the podcast Sibling Revelry with younger sister Kate., Per Kate, Oliver is quite the jokester, too. \"He really is funnier than me,\" she told PEOPLE in 2021. That same year, Oliver was featured in PEOPLE\'s 2021 Sexiest Man Alive issue., Oliver married his wife, Erinn Barlett, in 2006, though, he recalls Goldie\'s motherly push to get him down on one knee. \"To be honest, it was not easy. I didn\'t want to get married. I thought that the perfect relationship was Kurt and Mom,\" Oliver said on E!\'s Daily Pop in 2022. \"I mean, I was a child of divorce, that didn\'t work, and then I saw this working.\", Referring to his proposal as \"a major surprise,\" Oliver remembered Erinn telling her parents that a wedding was more than likely not in the cards. After a heartfelt conversation with his mom, Oliver knew it was the right choice: \"She says, \'It\'s [the ring] a token. You don\'t have to get married right away.\' And so I gave [Erinn] the ring and it was very scary and we were engaged for two and a half years.\", Oliver and Erinn are parents to sons Wilder Brooks and Bodhi Hawn and daughter Rio Laura. The actor\'s number one advice for fellow fathers? Always find ways to embarrass your kids. \"You\'re not a father unless you\'re embarrassing your children,\" he said during a 2022 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show., \"He\'s the greatest, most handsome, amazing father, actor, comedian, human, son,\" Hawn previously told PEOPLE of Oliver. \"I mean, he\'s such a gift. They\'re all gifts, all my children.\", Goldie and Bill\'s daughter Kate was born on April 19, 1979. The 2000 film Almost Famous made Kate (who starred as Penny Lane) an overnight sensation, earning her a Golden Globe for best supporting actress. Her career continued to skyrocket with films such as How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), Fool\'s Gold (2008), Bride Wars (2009) and Something Borrowed (2011)., Kate has always praised her mother and Kurt, who helped raise Kate alongside Goldie. In honor of Kurt\'s 70th birthday, Kate penned a heartfelt letter reexamining \"how different our life would have been if he never entered the picture.\", \"He\'s an original. One of kind. A powerful, intelligent, talented, loyal family man. He has taught me that we can all exist with immense love through our differences,\" she wrote on Instagram., \"He gave me the gift of confidence, instilling a knowingness in me that I deserved everything I worked for and I knew that he\'d always have my back in whatever challenges may lay ahead. When you have a dad who gives you permission to be confident, you live courageously,\" she added., Kate is a mom of three herself. She welcomed her son Ryder Robinson with ex-husband Chris Robinson in January 2004. She also shares a son Bingham Hawn Bellamy, who was born in 2011, with ex-fiancé Matt Bellamy. In 2018, Kate and her fiancé Danny Fujikawa welcomed daughter Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa., When it comes to navigating the ins and outs of co-parenting, Kate says she\'s learned from the best. \"I think the one thing that I learned from my mom is that no matter what you\'re feeling and no matter what — when I see my friends talking s--- about their ex-spouses in front of their kids, I get so upset because they don\'t recognize how much that affects their child and how resentful their child will become of them,\" the Fabletics founder said on a 2019 episode of the Divorce Sucks! With Laura Wasser podcast., \"No matter what, I never heard a bad word about my father,\" she said, adding, \"It\'s not our place to tell them [kids] how to feel about the other parents. I think that\'s so important.\", While the actress wouldn\'t \"recommend it [her situation] to most,\" she believes the relationships she\'s formed with each of her kids\' fathers are \"quite amazing,\" — even more amazing is the fact that the dads all get along as well!, \"We might not have been able to live together and sustain the distance, but at the end of the day, there\'s real love there. When the kids feel that I think, to them, it makes them feel safe and good,\" Kate said., Born on Feb. 16, 1980, Boston is Kurt\'s son whom he shares with actress and ex-wife Season Hubley. The pair met on the set of 1979\'s Elvis, in which they portrayed Elvis and Priscilla Presley. Their divorce came four years later, in 1983. Apart from the occasional red carpet appearance, Boston lives an ultra-private life, out of the spotlight., Kate, however, remembers the first time she met Boston as a young girl. \"For me, it felt like such a big moment because it was like, \'My mom is madly in love with this guy.\' For me, at the time, it was like, \'Is this going to be my dad?\' \" she recalled on her podcast Sibling Revelry. \"And I was meeting his son [Boston], which meant, \'Does this mean that this is my brother?\' It was a lot to handle at such a young age.\", Kurt and Goldie welcomed their son Wyatt Russell on July 10, 1986. Wyatt Russell rose to comedic fame after starring in 22 Jump Street (2014) and Table 19 (2017); however, Disney\'s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier cemented Wyatt into TV stardom in 2021. Wyatt will be working alongside his dad in Apple TV\'s upcoming live-action MonsterVerse series., Just like his parents, Wyatt met his wife on a movie set. He and actress Meredith Hagner fell in love while filming Folks Hero & Funny Guy in 2016 and got engaged in 2018. They wed in a Western-themed wedding in September 2019 at Goldie\'s house in Aspen, Colorado., Their family expanded in March 2021 with the arrival of their son, Buddy Prine Russell. Speaking with Entertainment Tonight, Wyatt described fatherhood as an \"incredible\" experience., \"It\'s everything you didn\'t know it was going to be,\" he told the outlet. \"I think everything you hope it\'s gonna be is like a mish-mash in your mind before it really happens and then after it happens, whatever happened before is almost like [it never happened].\", He continued, \"Biologically, I think it does something to your brain where you just erase half your life before you\'ve lived there.

I\'m proud of you kids because you could\'ve turned out quite differently.\", Justice Mellencamp was born in Indiana in August 1985 to Mellencamp and Granucci. After her parents divorced in 1989, she moved to Hilton Head, South Carolina, where she lived with her mom and older sister, Teddi., Growing up, Justice traveled with her father often.

Totally unplanned. That was sweet.\", Today, Justice is a professional hairdresser. She and her husband also have three children together. The pair welcomed their son, Trent, in 2005 while they were still in college. Their daughter, Dylan Carter, was born in 2016, followed by another daughter, Woods, in 2021., Mellencamp welcomed his first son, Hud Mellencamp, on April 27, 1994, with his third wife, Elaine Irwin., Like his siblings, Hud was born in Indiana, where he grew up with his parents and a younger brother. He also spent a great deal of time traveling with his dad., In an interview with PEOPLE, Mellencamp shared that after he and Irwin married, she wanted to ensure a more family-friendly atmosphere when he was on tour. \"There\'s not been anybody — no girls or hangers-on — backstage at my shows since then. Her advice was good,\" he said, adding that he brought his sons on the road with him., Still, despite giving them a taste of the rock star life, he wanted his children to appreciate their lifestyle. \"I try to make sure that my kids understand how fortunate they are and that they shouldn\'t take any of this for granted.\", Hud attended Duke University, where he played football. The 28-year-old is now working as an executive recruiter., Mellencamp and Irwin welcomed their second son, Speck Wildhorse Mellencamp, on April 23, 1995., According to USA Today, when Speck was 20 years old, he was reportedly sentenced to four days in jail after he and his brother pled guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge. He was arrested again in 2017 for public intoxication after he got into a physical altercation with Hud and was put on probation., Mellencamp seemingly addressed Speck\'s arrests during an interview with AARP in 2017. \"Here\'s what I told my son Speck, who\'s always fighting everybody and fighting himself. I said, \'I know you consider yourself a dangerous young man, but I\'m a dangerous old man.\' \", Since then, Speck has turned to a career in the arts. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design and is now the executive director of the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts. \"I drew a lot as a kid,\" he said in an interview with Indianapolis Monthly. \"My dad and I have collaborated on a few paintings.\"', '.', 'john-mellencamps-5-children-everything-to-know', NULL, NULL, 1, 0, '2023-03-30 19:34:31', '2023-03-30 19:34:31', NULL, NULL, 'https://people.com/parents/all-about-john-mellencamp-kids/'),

I\'m awake all night with the baby,\' to which he said, \'No, it\'s really good. She came along just at the right time — she\'s really helping your performance,\' \" he recalled., Now, Isabella is a typical teenager — meaning she loves to give her famous dad grief, especially about his less successful movies. \"If the reviews come out and they\'re terrible, then she\'ll watch it,\" Matt told E!

When she was just a toddler, she visited her father on the New Mexico set of True Grit in 2010. \"They were interested in seeing the horses,\" he said of his daughters\' trip to set. \"So, we got some pictures of them with the horses.\", The family also traveled to Africa while Matt was filming Invictus, where they got the opportunity to meet with Nelson Mandela. \"Lucy and I didn\'t even talk to him, we just let him hang out with the kids. He bounced them on his knee,\" Matt recalled of the once-in-a-lifetime meeting., \"Isabella and Gia couldn\'t take their eyes off him,\" he continued. \"They just were looking at each other, completely locked on each other the entire time.\", Matt and Luciana\'s youngest daughter, Stella, was born on Oct. 20, 2010, in New York City. \"It\'s been pretty crazy,\" Matt said of the time just after Stella\'s birth. \"The baby came a couple of weeks early. It\'s our fourth, so we\'ve done it before — but it\'s a whole new dynamic.\", The family has lived all over the world, including in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic, where they chose to stay even as production for The Last Duel paused. \"My family and I, we just took a vote and we decided to stay and it was a great decision,\" Matt said while appearing on the The Tonight Show with Ben Affleck in 2021. \"We had a great time there and just got absorbed into this beautiful little community.\", Matt and Luciana spent plenty of quality time with their daughters while in Ireland, engaging in some common at-home activities to pass the time — including DIY makeovers., \"I had let the kids dye my hair red. It was their art project basically, and it was clear that we weren\'t going back to work,\" Matt recalled to his pal Affleck. \"Then they decide that I needed a mohawk, so they mohawked me.\", After leaving Ireland, Matt and Luciana moved the family back to N.Y.C. \"We\'re moving at the end of the month and school\'s September.
